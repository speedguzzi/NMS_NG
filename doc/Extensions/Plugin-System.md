# Developing for the Plugin System

This documentation will hopefully give you a basis for how to write a plugin for NMS_NG.

A test plugin is available on GitHib: https://github.com/laf/Test

Plugins need to be installed into html/plugins

The structure of a plugin is follows:

```
html/plugins
            /PluginName
                       /PluginName.php
                       /PluginName.inc.php
```

The above structure is checked before a plugin can be installed.

All files / folder names are case sensitive and must match.

PluginName - This is a directory and needs to be named as per the plugin you are creating.

PluginName.php - This file is used to process calls into the plugin from the main NMS_NG install.
                 Here only functions within the class for your plugin that NMS_NG calls will be executed.
                 For a list of currently enabled system hooks, please see further down.
                 The minimum code required in this file is (replace Test with the name of your plugin):
```
<?php

class Test {
}

?>
```

PluginName.inc.php - This file is the main included file when browsing to the plugin itself.
                     You can use this to display / edit / remove whatever you like.
                     The minimum code required in this file is:
```
<?php

?>
```

### System Hooks ###

System hooks are called as functions within your plugin class, so for example to create a menu entry within the PLugin dropdown you would do:

```
  public function menu() {
    echo('<li><a href="plugin/p='.get_class().'">'.get_class().'</a></li>');
  }
```

This would then add the name and a link to your plugin.

The following system hooks are currently available:

menu()
* This is called to build the plugin menu system and you can use this to link to your plugin (you don't have to).
